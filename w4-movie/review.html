            <h2>REVIEW</h2>
            <b>Chris Starring</b> <i>February 8 2022</i>

            <p>Cars is a great movie in my opinion, because it tells a fun tale of a race car that goes on to become something bigger than he ever thought he would be. I've always really liked cars, so I may be <i>slightly</i> biased when it comes to the reason I enjoyed it. As a kid I always wanted to be like McQueen because he was fast, and because of his catchphrase, "I am speed". When I was around 7 or so I'd run around the house pretending to be a race car.</p>
            <br>
            <p>My favorite scene from the movie is easily when the four tuner cars come across Mack, falling asleep on the highway. I always loved how cool the intro scene looked. Snot rod was my favorite character when i was younger, but now that I actually know more about how cars work, what types there are, etc. I'd probably say it's boost.</p>
            <br>
            <p>To add to the statement above, the animators went out of their way to model them after real-world cars, which I think is a nice touch. For example, Snot Rod is based off of a 1970s Dodge Challenger. Boost is a Nissan 240SX/200SX.</p>
            <b>Trivia</b>
            <ul>
                <li>Did you know that The King was actually voiced by THE Richard Petty?</li>
                <li>While some may think DJ is based off a Subaru Forester or Kia Soul, he's actually a Scion xB.</li>
                <li>Did you know McQueen was based off a Chevrolet Corvette?</li>   
            </ul>

            <p>written in the screenshot as well, but checking the code on w3c resulted in an error saying I had an end stray tag despite not actually having one; it detected the end tag for my container as a stray end tag, so I'm not sure about that one.</p>
