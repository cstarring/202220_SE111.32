            <p style="font-size:25px;">Hi, my name is Chris Starring. I mainly enjoy making music and playing video games, but I like riding dirt bikes as well. I also always wanted to build a car up to high power levels. While I'm not attending NEIT or any classes for any kind of automotive field, I'd love to keep it as a side hobby and hopefully someday I have the money to spend on such a project. I have two dogs, which can be seen above. I've had them for around 12 years now, but they're still happy & energetic despite their age. My car can be seen in the image below, all the way to the right.</p>
